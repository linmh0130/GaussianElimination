# GaussianElimination
A program to solve Ax=b by Gaussian Elimination

This program can only solve questions with only one solution.

Firstly,input the rank of A after the output "Please input the rank of A:" (for example 2)

then input the matrix A after the output "Please input the matrix A:". For example:<br>
>1 3 `Enter`<br>
>2 4 `Enter`

At last input the vector b after the output "Please input the vector b:". For example:<br>
>1 2 `Enter`

Then the program can get the solution x and output:<br>
x = [1 0]
